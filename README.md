# Online CV - Xian (Shawn) Li

## About

This is my online cv which is built to help me finding my next job. It keeps updating once a while. 

What I like about this theme is that its simplicity and ease of use. Once you set up and modify the theme you prefer, all you need to do is keep updating the content in ``_data/data.yml``.

## Installation

* [Fork](https://github.com/xian49930/online-cv/fork) the repository
* Delete the `gh-pages` branch
* Re-create the `gh-pages` branch
* Go to settings and set Github Pages source as master.
* Your new site should be ready at `https://username.github.io/online-cv/`

Change all the details from one place: ``_data/data.yml``
